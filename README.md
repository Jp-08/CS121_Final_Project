# CS121_Final_Project

# I. Project Overview
- Pytunes, is a desktop application developed using Python, sqlite3, and the customtkinter library, aimed at providing users a sleek and user-friendly music library management system. It integrates a SQLite database to store and manage track details, such as title, artist, album, genre, and release year, along with user authentication for secure access. Key features include adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tracks in a table-like format, with intuitive navigation buttons for help, about, and library refresh functions. The application employs a modern UI with a dark theme and ensures robust error handling for seamless interaction. This project is designed for music enthusiasts seeking an elegant tool to organize their collections efficiently.
# II. Applied Python Concepts and Libraries
- In the Pytunes project, Python concepts, libraries, and functions were applied strategically to create a robust and interactive application. The sqlite3 library is utilized for database management, allowing the program to store, retrieve, and manipulate user data and track details with SQL queries. The customtkinter library is leveraged to build a modern and user-friendly GUI, providing advanced widgets and styling options, while traditional tkinter features, such as messagebox and simpledialog, are used for dialog boxes and notifications. Core Python concepts like functions, exception handling, and modular design ensure that each functionality—such as user authentication, registration, and track management—is encapsulated and reusable. String manipulation and validation techniques are applied to process user inputs, and control flow structures (e.g., conditionals and loops) manage user interaction seamlessly within the application. Together, these elements demonstrate Python’s flexibility in integrating databases and GUI frameworks for practical software solutions.
# III. Sustainable Development Goals
- SDG 4: Quality Education focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable education while promoting lifelong learning opportunities. Technology projects like Pytunes support this goal by fostering digital literacy, hands-on learning, and creative exploration, enabling learners to develop essential skills in programming, database management, and GUI design. By serving as open-source resources, such projects ensure equitable access to quality educational materials, especially in underserved regions. They demonstrate real-world problem-solving, connecting theoretical knowledge with practical applications, and empower educators with tools to teach modern coding principles effectively. In this way, Pytunes exemplifies how technology can enhance education and prepare individuals for the challenges of a digital world.

# IV. Instructions for running the program
- To run the Pytunes program, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, including sqlite3 and customtkinter. First, download or clone the project files. Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the Python script using the command python pytunes.py. The program will initialize the SQLite database and open the Pytunes application window, where you can log in, register, and manage music tracks. Make sure you have a compatible Python version (e.g., 3.7 or higher) and that the required libraries are installed in your environment.
